# ## Clone a buffer binding.
#
# Al buffer bindings are consumed if used as input
# sources.
#
# This method uses them as arguments (which only borrows
# the buffer), and re-prints them to stdout -- thus copying.
#
# # Example
#
#   src origin = !echo I will be consumed;
#   src copyca = clone $origin;
#
#   !sink-1 < $origin;
#   !sink-2 < #copyca;

def clone =
    !xs-write_out --echo $args;
